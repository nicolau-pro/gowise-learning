      "I am beyond happy with the progress my son has made through his one-to-one sessions. At first, he was extremely anxious, finding it hard to cope with new people and environments. But right from the start, everything was handled with so much patience, care and understanding. Before sessions began, we received a personalised social story that explained who his tutor was, what would happen and what to expect during the lessons. We went through it several times together and it made such a difference.When he finally met his tutor, he was calm, smiling and instantly comfortable.",
      "Now he absolutely loves his individualised tutoring sessions. He's starting to make marks with gentle hand-over-hand support, enjoys cooking and sensory activities and looks forward to every lesson. Communication is excellent. I always know how he's progressing and what new goals he's working on.One of the sweetest things is hearing him hum the songs his tutor sings during lessons. His eyes light up with excitement.",
