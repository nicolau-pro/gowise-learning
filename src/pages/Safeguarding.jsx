              <p>
                This policy sets out how we work to keep children and young
                people safe, how we respond if there are concerns and the
                standards we expect of everyone involved in our work.

                The term “child” refers to anyone under the age of 18, and the
                term “young person” refers to individuals aged 18 to 25. At
                GoWise Learning, safeguarding and protection is at the heart of
                everything we do and underpins our approach to education,
                wellbeing and professional conduct.

                  For roles involving direct contact with children and young

                2. Safeguarding Training, Awareness and Ongoing Development
              </h3>
              <p>
                At GoWise Learning, we see safeguarding training not as a
                one-off requirement but as an ongoing part of professional
                development, something that helps our team build knowledge,
                confidence and consistency over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make sure our standards stay high, staff and tutors have
                their work reviewed at least once a year through staff
                appraisals. This helps us check that our safeguarding policy and
                procedures are being followed in our daily practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) completes advanced,
                multi-agency safeguarding training at least every two years and
                takes part in extra courses that relate directly to our

              </ul>
              <p>
                As part of onboarding, every tutor must complete Safeguarding
                Children Level 2 training, which is renewed every two years at a
                minimum. This ensures that everyone at GoWise Learning fully
                understands their role in keeping children and young people safe
                and protected.

              <h3>3. Recognising & Responding to Concerns</h3>
              <p>
                All tutors at GoWise Learning play a vital role in safeguarding
                children and young people. Every tutor must understand that no
                single professional can see the whole picture of a child or
                young person's life. Protecting them from harm depends on
                everyone working together, sharing information, noticing signs
                of concern and acting quickly when something doesn't feel right.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>To do this effectively, all tutors should:</strong>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Be familiar with GoWise Learning's safeguarding systems
                  </strong>
                  , including how to record and report concerns and who to
                  contact (Designated Safeguarding Lead or Deputy).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Receive safeguarding level 2 training</strong> as part
                  of the recruitment process and receive regular updates
                  throughout the year, so their knowledge stays current and
                  relevant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Have access to and read</strong> the following key
                  documents:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      GoWise Learning's Safeguarding and Protection Policy for
                      Children and Young People

                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Know how to recognise and respond</strong> if a child
                  or young person discloses abuse or neglect, including how to
                  listen, record and report appropriately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    Be alert to indicators of abuse, neglect or exploitation
                  </strong>
                  , particularly where these may be less obvious due to a child
                  or young person's additional needs or vulnerabilities.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>4. Working Together</h3>
              <p>
                All tutors must understand that safeguarding is everyone's
                responsibility. It is not enough to notice concerns. Tutors must
                record, report and share those concerns following GoWise
                Learning's safeguarding procedures.
              </p>
              <p>
                When in doubt, tutors should always speak to the Designated
                Safeguarding Lead (DSL) for guidance. Acting promptly and
                sharing information appropriately can make a significant
                difference in ensuring that children and young people receive
                the right help at the right time.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Supporting Vulnerable Children and Young People</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Children and young people with SEND, SEMH, communication
                  differences or those dependent on carers may find it harder to
                  express concerns. We commit to using accessible means of
                  communication, allowing trusted adults to help, but not
                  relying solely on guardians if they may be implicated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We also ensure privacy and dignity in any intimate care,
                  medication support or personal assistance, following strict
                  protocols.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>6. Child and Young Person Participation & Voice</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We encourage children and young people to speak up about
                  worries in ways that feel safe to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We listen, whether that is verbal, non-verbal or through other
                  forms of communication and respect what they tell us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We involve children and young people in safeguarding and
                  protection practices in ways that are safe, meaningful and
                  appropriate to their age and understanding. This includes
                  listening to their views about their own safety and wellbeing,
                  encouraging them to speak up if they feel worried or unsafe
                  and creating opportunities for them to give feedback on the
                  support and environment we provide. While they are not
                  involved in the investigation or management of concerns, their
                  input helps us improve our safeguarding and protection
                  procedures and ensures our approach remains centred on the
                  needs of children and young people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  GoWise Learning is committed to listening to the views of the
                  children and young people we support, ensuring their feedback
                  helps shape our services and safeguarding practices. GoWise
                  Learning fosters a culture where children and young people
                  feel heard, valued and protected, by providing safe ways for
                  them to share their concerns and by acting on their input to
                  improve their learning and wellbeing.
                </li>

              <h3>7. Information Sharing & Working with Others</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>

                  Where required by law or best practice, we share information
                  responsibly, always respecting confidentiality and never
                  compromising the safety of a child or young person.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>8. Monitoring & Governance</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We regularly review our safeguarding and protection policies,
                  practices and incidents to learn and improve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is always a named member of senior leadership (DSL)
                  responsible for safeguarding oversight.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Safeguarding and protection are integrated into our staff
                  supervision, performance reviews, risk assessments and health
                  & safety procedures.
                </li>
